# Data-Science
I have completed several data science projects including delay analysis for the US aviation industry, analysis of medical insurance costs, and RFM analysis for an online retail business. These projects involved collecting and processing large and complex datasets to extract insights and knowledge that can be used to solve practical problems or make data-driven decisions. In the aviation industry, my analysis focused on identifying the root causes of delays and developing effective solutions to minimize them. For medical insurance, I analyzed cost trends and identified factors that contributed to higher costs. In the online retail project, I performed RFM analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and provided recommendations to optimize marketing campaigns. These projects required a range of skills, including data cleaning, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, and demonstrated my ability to deliver valuable insights to stakeholders.
